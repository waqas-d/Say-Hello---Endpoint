// Say Hello - Endpoint

// Designed an API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized greeting, such as "Hello, {user's name}." 

// Peer Reviewed By: Joseph Poncini
// Peer Review: API worked perfectly on both swagger and GitHub. I like how you used HttpGet and used conventional naming in how you routed it.
